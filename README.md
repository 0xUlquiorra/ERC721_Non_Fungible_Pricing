# ERC721_Non_Fungible_Pricing

## *Note:* I never finished this repo. It was a proof of concept and is not made to go to prod.

Feel free to use it as inspiration but it doesn't *work* work (`setPrices` has issues).

There is a more optimal solution to this using nonsensical bytecode and/or assembly.
